# How will Quantum Computers help Humans better understand the Universe?

---

## Background

Quantum computers operate by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference, to perform computations that are exponentially more efficient for certain tasks than classical computers. These devices can model and simulate complex systems that are otherwise impossible to study using traditional methods. Through the lens of Fractal Reality Theory (FRT), quantum computers represent tools that align with the universe’s inherent fractal, recursive, and informational structure. They can process and analyze the recursive dynamics, feedback loops, and non-linear interactions that define the cosmos, providing unprecedented insights into its foundational principles.
