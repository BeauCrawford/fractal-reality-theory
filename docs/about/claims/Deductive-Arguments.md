2. (P2) The universe exhibits adaptive behavior, as seen in emergent phenomena like galaxy formation and biological evolution.
3. (P3) Adaptive behavior is consistent with simulation processes, where systems refine themselves over time.
4. (P4) The universe’s self-contained nature ensures its evolution is internally driven and recursive.
