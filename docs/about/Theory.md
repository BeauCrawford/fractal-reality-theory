# Fractal Reality Theory: A Metatheory Rooted in Principles and Scientific Inquiry

## Description

**Fractal Reality Theory** is a **metatheory** that seeks to provide a systematic explanation of phenomena by exploring the interconnected dynamics between the universe as a macro-scale internal simulation and the nested micro-scale simulations of its constituent entities. It is grounded in the **true essence of a theory**—a coherent framework built on principles, reasoning, and evidence, while remaining open to refinement and testing.

## Key Foundations

1. **Theoretical Integrity**:
   - Adheres to the definition of "theory" as a **systematic explanation of phenomena**, derived from foundational principles and reasoning.
   - Recognizes that it is not settled science but instead a framework that:
     - Makes inferences from known phenomena.
     - Deduces logical relationships between micro and macro systems.
     - Introduces intuitive formulations to posit new ideas.

2. **Principle-Driven Framework**:
   - Rooted in **principles** that serve as fundamental truths guiding its structure:
     - The **Hermetic Principle of Correspondence**: "As above, so below," which connects macrocosmic and microcosmic processes.
     - The **Principle of Self-Simulation**: The universe is self-contained, self-referential, and emergent.
   - Seeks to unify scientific domains under these guiding principles, providing a cohesive explanation of reality.

## Interdisciplinary References

The Fractal Reality Theory draws on insights from diverse scientific disciplines to establish its reasoning and support its propositions:

1. **Quantum Physics**:
   - Explores the universe’s probabilistic and emergent nature, drawing on concepts like wavefunction collapse, entanglement, and the holographic principle.
   - Frames the universe as an informationally complete, self-sustaining system.

2. **Neuroscience**:
   - Parallels the brain’s **Cognitive Perception-Action Loop (CPAL)** with the universe’s feedback-driven simulation processes.
   - Investigates how localized "internal simulations" mirror larger-scale dynamics.

3. **Systems Theory and Complexity Science**:
   - Examines how feedback loops, emergence, and self-organization underlie both universal and micro-scale systems.
   - Models the fractal correspondence between levels of reality.

4. **Philosophy and Metaphysics**:
   - Embraces intuitive reasoning to integrate scientific insights with broader existential questions about the nature of reality and consciousness.

## Approach and Methodology

1. **Inference and Deduction**:
   - Draws logical inferences from established theories in quantum mechanics, neuroscience, and other fields to propose connections between the universe and its constituents.
   - Deductive reasoning is used to explore how self-simulating systems could operate across scales.

2. **Intuitive Exploration**:
   - Introduces novel ideas that expand on current scientific paradigms, such as the fractal interplay of self-simulations.
   - Positions these formulations as testable hypotheses for future exploration.

3. **Evidence-Based Referencing**:
   - Where possible, aligns propositions with empirical findings or well-supported theories.
   - Uses scientific references as a foundation while acknowledging areas that remain speculative.

## Adherence to Scientific and Philosophical Rigour

- **Commitment to "Theory"**:  
  - Provides a structured, principle-based explanation of phenomena, open to scrutiny, falsification, and refinement.
  - Does not assert definitive conclusions but instead offers a framework for ongoing investigation and synthesis.

- **Commitment to "Principle"**:  
  - Grounds itself in fundamental truths (e.g., correspondence, self-organization) that guide its reasoning and connect disparate observations.
  - Builds a coherent, philosophically robust foundation for understanding.

## Conclusion

Fractal Reality Theory stands as a metatheoretical framework that bridges science and philosophy, uniting quantum physics, neuroscience, and systems theory under the guiding principles of correspondence and self-simulation. It is not a claim to settled truth but an evolving, systematic explanation that integrates foundational concepts, scientific references, and innovative ideas to explore the interconnected nature of reality. It invites further investigation, critique, and collaboration to refine its propositions and advance our understanding of the cosmos.
