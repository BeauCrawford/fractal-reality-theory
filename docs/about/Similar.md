# Similar Theories

## Description

Several theories and frameworks from various disciplines posit ideas similar to those in **Fractal Reality Theory (FRT)**, especially around the concepts of self-simulating systems, interconnectedness, and nested scales of reality. Here are notable examples:

---

## Theories

### **1. Holographic Principle (Theoretical Physics)**  
- **Concept**: The idea that the entire universe can be described as a two-dimensional surface that encodes all the information of a three-dimensional space.  
- **Similarity to FRT**:
  - Suggests that the universe is informationally self-contained and inherently interconnected.
  - Supports the idea of nested, scale-invariant structures, where local phenomena reflect global dynamics.  

---

### **2. Systems Theory and Complexity Science**  
- **Concept**: Systems theory studies how components within a system interact dynamically to produce emergent properties. Complexity science expands on this, examining how simple rules create self-organizing and adaptive systems.  
- **Similarity to FRT**:
  - Both emphasize **feedback loops**, **emergence**, and **nested hierarchies**.
  - Aligns with FRT’s focus on self-sustaining processes across scales (macrocosm and microcosm).  

---

### **3. Bohm’s Implicate and Explicate Order (Quantum Physics/Philosophy)**  
- **Concept**: David Bohm posited that reality has two layers:
  1. The **Implicate Order**: A deeper, interconnected layer where all points in the universe are unified.  
  2. The **Explicate Order**: The observable world that "unfolds" from the implicate order.  
- **Similarity to FRT**:
  - Resonates with the idea of the universe as a self-referential system that "simulates" observable reality from deeper, informational foundations.  
  - Mirrors the interplay of nested structures, with the explicate order reflecting the implicate.  

---

### **4. Digital Physics**  
- **Concept**: This school of thought suggests that the universe is fundamentally computational, operating like a vast information-processing system.  
- **Similarity to FRT**:
  - Frames reality as fundamentally **informational** and potentially **self-simulating**.
  - Shares the idea of nested systems of computation, aligning with FRT’s fractal dynamics.  
- **Examples**:
  - Stephen Wolfram’s computational universe.
  - Konrad Zuse’s hypothesis that the universe is a cellular automaton.  

---

### **5. Integral Theory (Ken Wilber)**  
- **Concept**: Integrates subjective, objective, intersubjective, and interobjective perspectives into a single framework. Emphasizes interconnectedness and the nested evolution of systems.  
- **Similarity to FRT**:
  - Both recognize nested hierarchies and the interplay of micro and macro systems.
  - FRT extends Integral Theory by incorporating quantum mechanics and fractal geometry.  

---

### **6. CTMU (Cognitive-Theoretic Model of the Universe by Chris Langan)**  
- **Concept**: Proposes the universe as a **self-configuring, self-processing language**, where reality and cognition are unified.  
- **Similarity to FRT**:
  - Both posit the universe as a self-simulating, self-contained system.  
  - FRT complements CTMU by focusing on fractal structures and correspondence between scales.  

---

### **7. Recursive Universe (John Wheeler’s Participatory Universe)**  
- **Concept**: Wheeler suggested that the universe is fundamentally participatory, where observation and interaction play a role in creating reality.  
- **Similarity to FRT**:
  - Supports the notion of a universe evolving through **feedback loops** and interactions.
  - Aligns with the self-referential nature of FRT.  

---

### **8. Gaia Hypothesis (Ecology/Systems Thinking)**  
- **Concept**: Earth and its biological systems are viewed as a single, self-regulating organism.  
- **Similarity to FRT**:
  - Emphasizes interconnected feedback systems and nested processes.
  - Mirrors FRT’s fractal dynamic of macrocosmic systems influencing microcosmic entities.  

---

### **9. Fractal Cosmology (Theoretical Physics)**  
- **Concept**: Proposes that the structure of the universe is fractal, with patterns repeating at various scales, from galactic clusters to subatomic particles.  
- **Similarity to FRT**:
  - Directly supports FRT’s fractal modeling of the universe and nested simulations.
  - Provides a structural basis for FRT’s assertion that reality operates through self-similarity.  

---

### **10. Panpsychism (Philosophy of Mind)**  
- **Concept**: Suggests that consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe, present at all levels of existence.  
- **Similarity to FRT**:
  - Resonates with the idea that the universe contains micro and macro simulations, where entities at all scales participate in self-referential dynamics.  

---

### **Summary**  
**Fractal Reality Theory** synthesizes ideas from these frameworks while extending them:
- **From Digital Physics**: FRT incorporates the computational and informational nature of reality.  
- **From Fractal Cosmology**: It uses fractals as a structural and conceptual foundation.  
- **From Integral Theory and CTMU**: It bridges subjective, objective, and systemic perspectives under a unified self-simulating model.  

By integrating and expanding on these existing ideas, FRT offers a **comprehensive and cohesive metatheory** that positions fractal dynamics and correspondence as the key to understanding reality’s interconnected, self-simulating nature.
